## MASTERINTELLIGENCE — Vision Feature (Phase 6+)

**This changes the entire product.** Not a CSS task — a full product feature.

- **Energy Ball**: Autonomous AI entity visualized as a golden energy sphere (see `oculops_sidebar_navigation.png` mockup). Present in EVERY app section, floating freely with personality and movement
- **Voice Commands**: MasterIntelligence has its own voice, can run all app operations via voice commands
- **Self-Improvement**: Uses autoresearch loop (Karpathy path at `~/Documents/AI OPS/github-repos/autoresearch/`) to autonomously improve itself — modifies own train.py, trains, keep/revert by val_bpb
- **Presence**: Not a static widget — a living entity that moves between sections, reacts to data, pulses with activity, has personality and freedom
- **Implementation**: Canvas/WebGL energy ball component, Web Speech API for voice, integration with agent-brain-v2 for intelligence, autoresearch integration for self-improvement loop
- **Depends on**: Visual rebrand complete (Phase 0-5), agent-runner system, brain-v2

---

## NICE TO HAVE (not blocking)

- @tanstack/virtual for list virtualization (large contact/agent lists)
- pgvector IVFFlat → HNSW index upgrade when > 10k knowledge entries
- Workflow builder UI in Automation module
- PDF invoice generation in Billing
- Email templates for onboarding flow
- Dark/light theme toggle (currently OLED-only)

## SESSION 2026-03-10 (current)

- [ ] Redeploy the frontend to Vercel once DNS to `api.vercel.com` is reachable (both project and team lookups fail with ENOTFOUND).  
- [ ] Supply `APIFY_TOKEN` or valid Reddit credentials so `social-signals` can complete live ingestion without blocking on external `403` responses.  
- [ ] Provide `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (and optional thread) for Herald/Scribe report delivery to avoid manual routing.  
- [ ] Map the refreshed API catalog (access/theme/open-only groupings) into the automation/n8n flows so the agents can leverage the new filters.
