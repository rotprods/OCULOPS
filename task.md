# TASK.md — Unified Execution Matrix (Agent 1 + Agent 2)
Author: Roberto + Runtime Team  
Date: 2026-03-13  
Mode: Execution-first, parallel-safe

---

## 0) Objective
Unify:
1. `OCULOPS_AGENTIC_GAP_MAP` (agentic core build)
2. Current closed-loop sprint plan (`docs/implementation-plan.md` + `docs/sprint-01-closed-loop-mvp.md`)

into one execution matrix with strict ownership:
- **Agent 1 = Claude (other terminal)**
- **Agent 2 = Codex (this terminal)**

## 0.1) Runtime Progress Snapshot (Agent 2)
- `AG2-C0` ✅ Completed (registry + contracts scaffolded under `registry/**` and `contracts/**`)
- `AG2-C1` ✅ Completed baseline (goal classification + decomposition + dependency persistence + retry/escalation hooks in orchestration engine)
- `AG2-C4` ✅ Completed baseline (evaluation engine + score history table + orchestration integration)
- `AG2-C5` ✅ Completed + hardening pass (`simulation-engine` + `simulation_runs` + policy-gated pre-execution simulation in goals/pipelines + replay support + medium-risk production false-block fix + step trace continuity fix in pipeline_step_runs)
- `AG2-C6` ✅ Completed baseline (provider status persistence on dispatch failure/success + inbound/status reconciliation to existing conversations + `message_in` trigger preserved post-persistence + run failure/stuck taxonomy API)
- `AG2-C7` ✅ Completed baseline (synthetic smoke harness for orchestration/simulation/evaluation without provider dependencies + aggregated taxonomy listing API)
- New API actions available:
  - `orchestration-engine: plan_goal`
  - `orchestration-engine: execute_goal`
  - `orchestration-engine: plan_and_execute_goal`
  - `orchestration-engine: get_run_taxonomy`
  - `orchestration-engine: list_taxonomy`
  - `evaluation-engine: evaluate`
  - `evaluation-engine: get`
  - `evaluation-engine: list`
  - `simulation-engine: run`
  - `simulation-engine: get`
  - `simulation-engine: list`
  - `simulation-engine: replay`

## 5) Shared Integration Tasks (Both Agents, Scheduled Windows Only)

## INT-1 — Contract Freeze Window
- Variables: `V3.*`, `V5.*`
- Action:
  - Agent 2 publishes contract/registry changes.
  - Agent 1 adapts UI to those contracts only after freeze tag.

## INT-2 — Demo Workflow Pack (3 required)
- Variables: `V1.1`, `V2.*`
- Workflows:
  - `INT-2.1` bug -> patch -> test -> review
  - `INT-2.2` feature -> implement -> evaluate
  - `INT-2.3` campaign workflow -> execute -> score -> improve proposal

## INT-3 — Merge Gate
- Variables: `V5.4`
- Required before integration:
  - `eslint` passes
  - targeted tests pass
  - `build` passes

---

## 6) Execution Order (Now)
1. `AG2-C0` registries + contracts
2. `AG2-C1` orchestration hardening
3. `AG2-C4` evaluation baseline
4. `AG2-C5` memory/simulation skeleton
5. `AG1-P0` + `AG1-P2` UI diagnostics + E2E proof
6. `INT-2` run three real workflows and score

---

## 7) Definition Of Done (Unified)
- Closed loop is verifiable from UI and persisted backend state.
- Agent registry + tool registry + workflow registry are canonical.
- All important outputs are scored with pass/fail and retry semantics.
- Simulation exists for high-risk changes before production.
- Agent autonomy is policy-gated (budget/tool/risk/escalation).

---

## 8) Non-Negotiable Rules
1. No new random agents outside registry.
2. No direct tool access bypassing tool bus.
3. No high-impact output without evaluation.
4. No self-improvement directly on production without simulation/policy gate.
5. No cross-agent file overlap without explicit lock.
